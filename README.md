# web-client
Web client for the Alive database server, as part of the
[Alive system](https://epics-alive-server.github.io/) used by the
Beamline Controls Group of the Advanced Photon Source.

## Documentation
* [Installation notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epics-alive-server/web-client/master/docs/installation.txt)

This is the original web client.  I'm working on a newer
heavily-reworked version that is moving towards doing all data
processing locally in Javascript, instead of on the server.  This will
install alongside the version presented here (with a different name).
