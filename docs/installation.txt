Web Client for the APS Alive System


Dependencies
------------

This program requires gcc, make, and two external libraries.

It uses the alive-client library and my CGI library, dcgi.  The
aliveclient library can be found at
"https://github.com/epics-alive-server/client-tools", and the dcgi can
be found at "https://github.com/dohnarms/dcgi".  You don't need to
install them after compiling.


Makefile Options
----------------

There are several options in the top-level Makefile that need to be
set.

The "prefix" and "cgi_bin_dir" variables control where the resultant
CGI binary is installed.  Ignore these if you aren't going to use
"make" to install the file.

If the alive-client library files aren't in standard locations for
libraries and header files (thus automatically found by the compiler),
set "AliveClient_Library_Dir" and "AliveClient_Include_Dir" variables
to their locations. Similary, for dcgi, set "DCGI_Library_Dir" and
"DCGI_Include_Dir".

"Server", and "DB_Port" specify the alive database server IP address
(or name) and TCP port number.  If either is not defined, the default
value is retrieved from the alive-client library.


Installation
------------

If you run "make install", the executable ioc_alive.cgi will be
installed to the location that is specified in the Makefile.  If it's
in the web site's cgi-bin directory, you probably access it as
"http://webserver/cgi-bin/ioc_alive.cgi"
